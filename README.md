Abstract—Identifying pedestrians through structural vibra-
tions offers a promising approach for smart infrastructure and
surveillance systems. This research enhances the FootprintID
framework by incorporating intelligent wrapper-based feature
selection methods to improve both accuracy and computational
speed. Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were evaluated
using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Forward Feature
Selection (FFS), revealing that the FFS-optimized SVM struck
the most effective balance between precision and recall. The op-
timized system boosted accuracy from 50% with a baseline SVM
to 54% using FFS, showcasing its scalability and effectiveness for
indoor identification in acoustically sensitive settings.
